## 🚨 IMMEDIATE FIXES (Do Today - 30 Minutes)

### Fix #1: Get Google to Index Your Pages

**Problem:** Google found your pages but isn't indexing them (shown in your screenshot).

**Solution:**
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Click "Sitemaps" in left menu
3. Add this sitemap URL: `https://justice-bot.com/sitemap.xml`
4. Click "Submit"
5. For each unindexed page, go to "URL Inspection"
6. Paste the URL (e.g., `https://justice-bot.com/forms`)
7. Click "Request Indexing"

**Do this for:**
- /forms
- /court-information
- /low-income-approval
- /pricing

**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Result:** Pages will be indexed within 1-3 days

### Fix #2: Fix Your Email Security (DNS Records)

**Problem:** Your domain has email security issues (SPF, DMARC errors shown in screenshot).

**Only do this if you're sending emails from justice-bot.com**

**Solution:**
1. Log into your domain registrar (where you bought justice-bot.com)
2. Find "DNS Management" or "DNS Settings"
3. Add these records:

**SPF Record:**
- Type: TXT
- Name: @
- Value: `v=spf1 include:_spf.mx.cloudflare.net ~all`

**DMARC Record:**
- Type: TXT
- Name: _dmarc
- Value: `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:admin@justice-bot.com`

**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Result:** Email security issues resolved in 24-48 hours

Features:

- Auto-filled court forms
- Plain-language explanations

Happy to provide more details.
