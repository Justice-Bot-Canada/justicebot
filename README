🛠 Development

Install dependencies:

npm install


Run the dev server:

npm run dev


The development preview should match what you see inside Lovable.

🧪 Build

To create a production build locally:

npm run build


Preview the production bundle:

npm run preview


This ensures the local build works before deploying to Cloudflare.

🌐 Deployment (Cloudflare Pages)

The site is automatically deployed from the main branch via Cloudflare Pages.

🔄 Fixing Stale/Corrupted Builds on Cloudflare Pages

Because Cloudflare may serve cached or stale JS bundles, you can fix JS initialization or hydration errors by doing any of the following:

Option A — Re-deploy latest build

Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages → justice-bot

Deployments → Retry deployment

Option B — Force a new deploy

Make any small commit to GitHub (e.g. update this README).
Cloudflare will deploy a fresh build.

Option C — Purge cache

Cloudflare Dashboard → Caching

Purge Everything

This clears stale JS/CSS bundles from Edge.

Option D — Full reset (rarely needed)

Delete the project on Cloudflare Pages → re-create it pointing to the repo.

🔐 Environment Variables (if used)

Create a .env file:

VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
API_BASE_URL=...


Or configure them in Cloudflare Pages → Settings → Environment Variables.

🧭 Roadmap

Add more legal domains & templates
